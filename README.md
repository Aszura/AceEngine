# Ace Engine
The Ace Engine is the latest game engine project from 08/2015.

It features a component based 3D game engine that can be easily extended. Levels are loaded via XML to offer the possibility to implement an independent editor. Currently the renderer is based on the OpenGL API. The components are stored in highly-optimized packed arrays.

# Libraries
The game engine uses the following libraries:
* SFML: Image loading, context creation, audio and input
* Assimp: 3D model loading
* NVidia PhysX
* OpenGL Math
* Glew

# Controls
Mouse: Look around
WASD: Move player
Space: Jump
